- ## Approach 2:- Prefix Sum Approach using Monotonic Queue
    - ### Intuition
        We are tasked with finding a contiguous subarray whose sum is greater than or equal to `k`. A brute-force approach would involve checking all possible subarrays, calculating their sums, and tracking the shortest one that meets the condition. However, this would take **O(n^2)** time, which could be too slow for large input sizes.

        Instead, we can use a **sliding window** or **prefix sum** technique along with a **monotonic deque** to improve efficiency. The basic idea is to keep track of the cumulative sum (prefix sum) and use a deque to efficiently find the shortest subarray whose sum meets or exceeds `k`. 

    - ### Approach
        1. **Prefix Sum**:
            - We maintain a running sum, `prefix_sum`, that represents the sum of elements from the start of the array up to the current index.
        2. **Monotonic Deque**:
            - We use a deque (`queue`) to store pairs of `(prefix_sum, index)`. The deque is maintained in such a way that the prefix sums are ordered from smallest to largest.
            - The idea is to always look for a subarray whose sum is at least `k`. If `prefix_sum[i] - prefix_sum[j] >= k` (where `j < i`), it indicates a valid subarray from index `j+1` to `i`.
        3. **Deque Operations**:
            - For each element in the array:
                - **Remove invalid subarrays**: If the difference between the current prefix sum and the prefix sum at the front of the deque is greater than or equal to `k`, it means we have found a subarray with sum at least `k`. We update the shortest length and remove the front element from the deque.
                - **Maintain order in the deque**: Remove elements from the back of the deque if the current prefix sum is smaller than the last elementâ€™s prefix sum. This ensures that the deque remains ordered in increasing prefix sums.
                - **Add the current prefix sum and index**: We then push the current `prefix_sum` and its index to the deque.
        4. **Edge Cases**:
            - If no valid subarray is found by the end of the iteration, return `-1`.
            - Handle cases where the array is empty or all values are negative.

                    # This represents the sum of elements before the array starts (prefix sum of 0 at index -1).

                        prefix_sum += nums[index]

                        # is greater than or equal to k. This means we have found a subarray with sum >= k.
                        while len(queue) and prefix_sum - queue[0][0] >= k:
                            # Update the shortest subarray length by comparing it with the current subarray length
                            shortest_Subarray_Length = min(shortest_Subarray_Length, index - queue[0][1])

                        # remove elements from the back of the deque. This ensures the deque is always ordered in increasing prefix sums.
                        while len(queue) and prefix_sum < queue[-1][0]:
                            queue.pop()

                        queue.append((prefix_sum, index))

                    # If no valid subarray was found, return -1

    - ### Time Complexity
        - **Outer loop**: We iterate through each element of the array once.
        - **Deque operations**: Each element is pushed and popped from the deque at most once.
        - Overall, each element is processed in constant time due to efficient deque operations, which gives us a linear time complexity.
        - **Time Complexity:** **O(n)**, where `n` is the length of the input array.

    - ### Space Complexity
        - We use a deque to store pairs of `(prefix_sum, index)`. In the worst case, the deque will store all `n` elements of the array (if all prefix sums are unique).
        - Therefore, the space complexity is determined by the number of elements in the deque.
        - **Space Complexity:** **O(n)**, where `n` is the length of the input array.
